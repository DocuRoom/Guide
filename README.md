## What is DocuRoom ?

**DocuRoom** is an online repository of information that is used for the storing and distribution of documents. In many cases, **DocuRoom** is used to facilitate the due diligence process during an M&A transaction, loan syndication, or private equity and venture capital transactions. This due diligence process has traditionally used a physical data room to accomplish the disclosure of documents. For reasons of cost, efficiency and security, **DocuRooms** have widely replaced the more traditional physical data room.
